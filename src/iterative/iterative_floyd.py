Floyd's Algorithm Implementation

This module implements a simple version of Floyd's algorithm for computing the
shortest paths in a graph. It contains these main functions:
- main: Controls the execution of the script.
- print_out_graph: Outputs the graph with node distances.
- iterative_floyd: Computes the shortest path.

Global variables:
- NO_PATH: Marker for no paths (set to sys.maxsize).
- GRAPH: Adjacency matrix containing distances between nodes.
- MAX_LENGTH: Graph dimension.
- NO_PATH_MARKER: Placeholder for unreachable paths in the output.
